CHAPTER 1: DATA COLLECTION

- 1.1 Introduction to the Practice of Statistics
  - (1) Define statistics and statistical thinking
    - **Statistics** is the science of collecting, organizing, summarizing, and analyzing information to draw conclusions or answer questions. In addition, statistics is about providing a measure of confidence in any conclusions.
    - **Data** is a fact or proposition used to draw a conclusion or make a decision; data describes characteristics of an individual
    - In statistics, when a problem is solved, the results do not have 100% certainty
  - (2) Explain the process of statistics
    - The entire group to be studied is called the **population**. An **individual** is a person or object that is a member of the population being studied. A **sample** is a subset of the population that is being studied.
    - A **statistic** is a numerical summary of a sample. **Descriptive statistics** consist of organizing and summarizing data. Descripe statistics describe data through numerical summaries, tables, and graphs.
    - **Inferential statistics** uses methods that take a result from a sample, extend it to the population, and measure the reliability of the result.
    - A **parameter** is a numerical summary of a population.
    - The Process of Statistics
      - (1) Identify the research objective
      - (2) Collect the data needed to answer the question(s) posted in (1)
      - (3) Describe the data
      - (4) Perform inference
  - (3) Distinguish between qualitative and quantitative variables
    - **Variables** are the characteristics of the individuals within the population
    - **Qualitative, or categorical, variables** allow for classification of individuals based on some attribute or characteristic.
    - **Quantitative variables** provide numerical measures of individuals. The values of a quantitative variable can be added or subtracted and provide meaningful results.
    - An **approach** is a way to look at and organize a problem so that it can be solved.
    - Just because the value of a variable is numeric does not mean that the variable is quantitative.
  - (4) Distinguish between discrete and continuous variables
    - We can further classify quantitative variables into two types: discrete and continuous
    - A **discrete variable** is a quantitative variable that has either a finite number of possible values or a countable number of possible values. The term *countable* means that the values result from counting, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. A discrete variable cannot take on every possible value between any two possible values.
    - A **continuous variable** is a quantitative variable that has an infinite number of possible values that are not countable. A continuous variable may take on every possible value between any two values.
    - The list of observed values for a variable is **data**.
    - **Qualitative data** are observations corresponding to a qualitative variable.
    - **Quantitative data** are observations corresponding to a quantitative variable.
    - **Discrete data** are observations corresponding to a discrete variable.
    - **Continuous data** are observations corresponding to a continuous variable.
  - (5) Determine the level of measurement of a variable
    - Rather than classify a variable as qualitative or quantitative, we can assign a level of measurement to the variable
    - A variable is at the **nominal level of measurement** if the values of the variable name, label, or categorize. In addition, the naming scheme does not allow for the values of the variable to be arranged in a ranked or specific order.
    - A variable is at the **ordinal level of measurement** if it has the properties of the nominal level of measurement, however the naming scheme allows for the values of the variable to be arranged in a ranked or specific order.
    - A variable is at the **interval level of measurement** if it has the properties of the ordinal level of measurement and the differences in the values of the variable have meaning. A value of zero does not mean the absence of the quantity. Arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction can be performed on values of the variable.
    - A variable is at the **ratio level of measurement** if it has the properties of the interval level of measurement and the ratios of the values of the variable have meaning. A value of zero means the absence of the quantity. Arithmetic operations such as multiplication and division can be performed on the values of the variable.
    - Nominal or ordinal variables are also qualitative variables
    - Interval or ratio variables are also quantitative variables
