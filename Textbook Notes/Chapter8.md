CHAPTER 8: SAMPLING DISTRIBUTIONS

- 8.1 Distribution of the Sample Mean
  - The **sampling distribution** of a statistic is a probability distribution for all possible values of the statistic computed from a sample of size n
  - The **sampling distribution of the sample mean** x-bar is the probability distribution of all possible values of the random variable x-bar computed from a sample of size n from a population with mean mew and standard deviation sigma
  - (1) Describe the distribution of the sample mean: normal population
    - The Mean and Standard Deviation of the Sampling Distribution of x-bar
      - Suppose that a simple random sample of size n is drawn from a population with mean mew and standard deviation sigma. The sampling distribution of x-bar has mean equal to mew and standard deviation equal to sigma divided by the square root of n (the sample size). The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of x-bar, sigma sub x, is called the **standard error of the mean**
    - The Shape of the Sampling Distribution of x-bar if X Is Normal
      - If a random variable X is normally distributed, the sampling distribution of the sample mean, x-bar, is normally distributed				
  - (2) Describe the distribution of the sample mean: nonnormal population
    - The Central Limit Theorem
      - Regardless of the shape of the underlying population, the sampling distribution of x-bar becomes approximately normal as the simple size, n , increases
- 8.2 Distribution of the Sample Proportion
  - (1) Describe the sampling distribution of a sample proportion
    - Suppose that a random sample of size n is obtained from a population in which each individual either does or does not have a certain characteristic. The **sample proportion**, p-hat, is given by p-hat = x / n, where x is the number of individuals in the sample with the specified characteristic. The sample proportion, p-hat, is a statistic that estimates the population proportion, *p*.
    - Sampling Distribution of p-hat
      - For a simple random sample of size *n* with a population proportion *p*:
        - The shape of the sampling distribution of p-hat is approximately normal provided np(1 - p) >= 10.
        - The mean of the sampling distribution of p-hat is mew-sub-p-hat = *p*.
        - The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of p-hat is given in a formula.
