CHAPTER 9: ESTIMATING THE VALUE OF A PARAMETER

- 9.1 Estimating a Population Proportion
  - (1) Obtain a point estimate for the population proportion
    - A **point estimate** is the value of a statistic that estimates the value of a parameter
    - Note: we agree to round proportions to three decimal places
  - (2) Construct and interpret a confidence interval for the population proportion
    - A **confidence interval** for an unknown parameter consists of an interval of numbers based on a point estimate
    - The **level of confidence** represents the expected proportion of intervals that will contain the parameter if a large number of different samples is obtained. The level of confidence is denoted (1 - alpha) x 100%
    - Whether a confidence interval contains the population parameter depends solely on the value of the sample statistic. ANy sample statistic that is in the tails of the sampling distribution will result in a confidence interval that does not include the population parameter.
    - The **critical value** of the distribution represents the number of standard deviations the sample statistic can be from the parameter and still result in an interval that includes the parameter
    - Interpretation of a Confidence Interval
      - A (1 - alpha) x 100% confidence interval indicates that (1 - alpha) x 100% of all simple random samples of size n from the population whose parameter is unknown will result in an interval that contains the parameter.
    - **A 90% level of confidence *does not* tell us there is a 90% probability the parameter lies between the upper and lower bound**
    - As the level of confidence increases, the margin of error also increases
    - As the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases
  - (3) Determine the sample size necessary for estimating a population proportion within a specified margin of error
    - Sample Size Needed for Estimating the Population Proportion p
      - There are two formulas for the sample size required to obtain a (1 - alpha) x 100% confidence interval for p with a margin of error E, depending on whether p-hat, a prior estimate of p, is available. In both cases the result is **rounded up to the next integer** (not rounded off, like normal)

- 9.2 Estimating a Population Mean
  - (1) Obtain a point estimate for the population mean
    - The point estimate of mew is x-bar
  - (2) State properties of Student's t-distribution
    - Properties of the t-Distribution
      - (1) The t-distribution is different for different degrees of freedom.
      - (2) The t-distribution is centered at 0 and is symmetric about 0.
      - (3) THe area under the curve is 1. The area under the curve to the right of 0 equals the area under the curve to the left of 0, which equals 1/2.
      - (4) As t increases or decreases without bound, the graph approaches, but never equals, zero.
      - (5) The area in the tails of the t-distribution is a little greater than the area in the tails of the standard normal distribution, because we are using s as an estiamte os sigma, thereby introducing further variability into the t-statistic.
      - (6) As the sample size n increases, the density curve of t gets closer to the standard normal density curve. This result occurs because, as the sample size increases, the values of s get closer to the value of sigma, by the Law of Large Numbers.
  - (3) Determine t-values
    - Similar to z-alpha notation, t-alpha represents the t-value whose area under the t-distribution to the right of t-alpha is alpha
    - The value of t-alpha depends not only on alpha, but also on the degrees of freedom, n - 1
    - Use Table VII for the t-distribution
    - The last row of Table VII lists the z-values from the standard normal distribution, use these values when the degrees of freedom are more than 1000 b/c the t-distribution starts to behave like the standard normal distribution as n increases
  - (4) Construct and interpret a confidence interval for a population mean
    - Constructing a (1 - alpha) x 100% Confidence Interval for mew
      - Provided:
        - (1) sample data come from a simple random sample or randomized experiment
        - (2) sample size is small relative to the population size (n <= 0.05N)
        - (3) the data come from a population that is normally distributed, or the sample size is large
          - If the sample size is small, use a Normal Probability Plot and the critical value from Table VI
        - (4) there are no outliers
          - Use a boxplot to determine if there are any outliers
      - The formulas for lower bound and upper bound are given
  - (5) Determine the sample size needed to estimate a population mean within a specified margin of error
    - Determining the Sample Size n
      - The formula for n depends on z-(alpha / 2), not t-(alpha / 2)
      - n is rounded up to the nearest whole number
